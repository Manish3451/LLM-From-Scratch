# Building a Large Language Model from Scratch

</p>

## Overview

This project implements a complete pipeline for building, training, and fine-tuning a GPT-2 style language model from scratch using PyTorch. The implementation covers all fundamental stages, from data preparation and tokenization to building the transformer architecture, pretraining on unlabeled data, and fine-tuning for downstream classification tasks.

This work is based on the comprehensive concepts detailed in the book **Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)** by Raschka, Mirjalili, and D'Souza.

## Three-Stage Training Pipeline

The project follows a systematic three-stage approach to build and deploy a production-ready language model, leveraging the power of transfer learning.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Screenshot%202025-10-21%20163332.png" alt="Three-Stage Training Pipeline" width="900"/>
</p>

### Stage 1: Building the LLM

#### 1. Data Preparation & Sampling
- Tokenization of raw text using OpenAI's `tiktoken` library (GPT-2 Byte-Pair Encoder).  
- Creation of input-target pairs using a sliding window approach.  
- Custom PyTorch DataLoader for efficient batch processing.

```python
# Custom DataLoader creates batches for training the language model
train_loader = create_dataloader_v1(
    train_data,
    batch_size=2,
    max_length=GPT_CONFIG_124M["context_length"],
    stride=GPT_CONFIG_124M["context_length"],
)
````

#### 2. Attention Mechanism

* Causal multi-head self-attention implementation.
* Scaled dot-product attention with causal masking.
* Multiple attention heads to capture diverse semantic relationships.

#### 3. LLM Architecture

* Transformer model with embedding layers.
* Stacked transformer blocks with attention and feed-forward networks.
* Layer normalization and residual connections for stability.

---

### Stage 2: Pretraining the Foundation Model

#### 4. Pretraining

* Training on `the-verdict.txt` corpus using next-token prediction.
* Model learns language patterns, grammar, and semantic relationships.

#### 5. Training Loop

```python
# Simplified training loop
def train_model_simple(model, train_loader, val_loader, optimizer, device, num_epochs, ...):
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for input_batch, target_batch in train_loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss = calc_loss_batch(input_batch, target_batch, model, device)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
```

#### 6. Model Evaluation

* Validation on held-out data to monitor convergence.
* Regular checkpointing to save model progress.

---

### Stage 3: Fine-Tuning for Downstream Tasks

#### 7. Load Pretrained Weights

* Initialize with official GPT-2 (124M) pretrained parameters.
* Automatic download via `gpt_download3.py`.

#### 8. Fine-Tuning for Classification

* Adaptation for spam detection using SMS Spam Collection dataset.
* Replace language modeling head with a classification head.
* Parameter-efficient fine-tuning by freezing most layers.

```python
# Replace the output head for 2-class (spam/ham) classification
num_classes = 2
model.out_head = torch.nn.Linear(
    in_features=BASE_CONFIG["emb_dim"], 
    out_features=num_classes
)

# Unfreeze only the final transformer block for efficient training
for param in model.trf_blocks[-1].parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True
for param in model.final_norm.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True
```

#### 9. Fine-Tuning for Chat

* Adaptation for conversational AI using instruction-following datasets.
* Model trained to follow user instructions and maintain context.

## Model Architecture

The model implements a GPT-2 style transformer built from scratch using PyTorch.

```python
# GPT-2 Small (124M) configuration
GPT_CONFIG_124M = {
    "vocab_size": 50257,
    "context_length": 1024,
    "emb_dim": 768,
    "n_heads": 12,
    "n_layers": 12,
    "drop_rate": 0.1,
    "qkv_bias": False
}
```

### Core Components

**Token & Position Embeddings:**

* Token embeddings map tokens to 768-dimensional vectors.
* Positional embeddings encode sequence order.

**Transformer Blocks:**

* Causal Multi-Head Self-Attention
* Feed-Forward Network (2-layer MLP with GELU activation)
* Layer Normalization
* Residual Connections

If you want, I can also make a **more concise “GitHub-friendly” version** that’s visually appealing with badges, collapsible sections, and direct links for running notebooks, which is great for attracting recruiters and contributors.  

Do you want me to do that next?
